hockey simulation(cirremtly at dev) stage.

my plan is to get the main version ready until the 4 nations tournament begins. The game is my first visual game and im eager to learn  so plz dotÂ´nt be too harsh :D
the game is still quite buggy and the players aint doing what they are told, but im getting there slowly. if somebody want to help me, let me know!

in future we can play this over interwebs, mobile, tablet, desktop, laptop and pretty much any device with internet or not.

my plan is to have all 4 nations teams players and linechanges working. The players have stamina, strenght, speed, age etc etc.. and many players have special skills that can lead you to easy victory if the stars align right that night for you.

this is still standalone versio "AI" vs "AI", soon i will be introducin local multiplayer (same pc/laptop), mobile/tablet version (online and offline) and also multiplayer over internet with friends or randoms.

localization is also in plans for few countries, sweden, usa and canada and maybe even more if people get interested, after the 4 nations i will start focusin on NHL and working on v2 of the game and it should be quite big change. will see!

If you are intersted about the project, let me know*"
